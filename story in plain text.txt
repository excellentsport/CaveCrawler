"After about 100 yards of excruciatingly slow shuffling, the tunnel begins to brighten. 
"It’s finally bright enough for you to see your hands in front of your face.",
"After another hundred yards of now-quicker walking, your elation at having some light quickly changes to fear as you begin to hear what sounds like whispers and the scuffling of feet to your starved senses.",
"Occasionally you hear a ‘thunk’ that echoes enough times to raise the hair on your neck."

You reach the mouth of a cavern, lit somewhat by more blue fluorescent moss. 
On one side of the cavern is a small creek, about three feet wide and flowing slowly, it’s origin somewhere off to the side in the distance. 
The creek is beset on either side by small rocks and sand, not unlike that of the first cavern you found yourself in. 
The water flows off to your left to about a stone’s throw away, at which point it immediately drops away.

To the right, up the creek a short distance, is a small wooden water wheel, spinning slowly with the water’s flow, which spins a series of gears, ultimately causing a wooden beam the size of your arm to raise and periodically drop onto a small raised wooden pedestal. 
A large wooden chest sits next to the wooden platform, unlocked. 
You hadn’t noticed before, but a small tin sits atop a metal grate, deep in a hole near the chest, above a fire gives off no smoke.
‘Finally!’ you think. ‘Somebody that might know what the heck is going on!’

“Are you the one making all that racket?
